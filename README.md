# HW1: Biography
### Author: Harry Won Seok Lee

I am a graduate student currently completing the *Master of Arts Program in Social Sciences* (MAPSS). I major in **International Political Economy** and I am currently researching the political economy of export restrictions on natural resources. My other academic/non-academic interests include:

1. Academic 
* State Capitalism 
* Firm-based theories of trade 
* Commercial Institutional Peace Theory 
* Nationalism 

2. Non-academic
* English Premiership (Soccer)
* Cooking curry
* Frying chicken
* Running about

*Nowadays of course, I find there is less time for my non-academic interests.*

Before coming to University of Chicago, I used to work as a journalist in Beijing, China at a company called [Caixin Media](https://www.caixinglobal.com/) (pronounced chai-shin). Besides Caixin, I also used to write about East Asian politics for publications like the Diplomat and Chinafile--my previous work can be viewed on this link to my [blog](http://fromlibrarycourt.tumblr.com/).  What I miss about Beijing the most are the areas located in the centre of the city with small traditional streets, called Hutongs. Below are the pictures of my favourite peking duck restaurant in one such area:
